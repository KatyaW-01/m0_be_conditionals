# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    It is useful to use a conditional in your code when you want to compare variables or if you want your code to do different things depending on different variables or conditions
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    If I could do this assignment over, I would google things less. There was one time I looked something up but then realized if I had thought through it a little more I probably could have figured it out on my own. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    It was very satisfying to be able to write code and have it work the first time and just in general to feel like I know what I am doing and feel like I have a good foundation of skills going into Mod1.
